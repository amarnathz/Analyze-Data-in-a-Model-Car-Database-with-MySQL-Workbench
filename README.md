# Analyze-Data-in-a-Model-Car-Database-with-MySQL-Workbench


 Mint Classics Company is hoping to close one of their storage facilities. They want 
suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely 
service to their customers.

Use SQL queries to analyze the data. 
1) Identify patterns. Are some items sold more often than others? Does the price seem to affect 
sales?
2) Conduct what-if analysis. For example, what impact would it have on the company and 
customer service if we reduced the quantity on hand for every item by 5%? 
3) Use your findings and conclusions to formulate some suggestions that the client could use to 
address the business question. Be innovative and feel free to include more than one scenario for 
whether or not it is viable to close a storage warehouse. Just be sure to back your ideas up with 
dataâ€”in the form of one or more saved scripts/queries.
